# Shop App:
This mobile app has some basic features that any shopping app has.

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository: Clone the Git repository using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash 
    git clone git@github.com:datumbrain/shop-app.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash 
    flutter pub get
    ```
    This command will install all the required dependencies for your Flutter app.

3. Run the app: After installing the dependencies, connect an Android or iOS device to your computer, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to start the app:
    ```bash 
    flutter run
    ```
    This will build and run the app on your default emulator or connected device.
4. (Optional) Build the app: If you want to build the app for a specific platform, run the following command:
    ```bash 
    flutter build <platform>
    ```
    Replace <platform> with the platform you want to build the app for, such as apk for Android or ipa for iOS. This will create a build of your app that you can distribute or install on your device
